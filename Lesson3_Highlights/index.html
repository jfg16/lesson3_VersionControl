            <p class="lead"> As time passed, editing always existed since the very moment that writing was created and revisions were necessary to constantly improve the documents. When the computer age came about, editing came difficult, especially if not written. Though version control systems (VCS) were created so revisions and editing could be made easier. It stores all forms/versions of a document or program and allows for tracking to occur in case an error is made or all data is lost on the original. Git is an example of a version control system, even being a free and open-source distribution VCS so many hosts can edit and review the file(s). </p>

            <p class="lead">A repository is a location where a file is stored so when referring to a remote repository, the file is stored in a faraway location from the owner and/or creator. Github is a remote repository where people can publish their files and codes to people, a team or even the world. </p>
            <p class="lead">Local repository, on the other hand, is the location where the original or copy of the file is located and being viewed by an individual. It contains the temporary versions of the file until they are allowed to accessed by others. This allows for easier file sharing, managing and editing. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As with any remote repository, Git uses commands in order to not only sync up the local and remote repositories, but also perform various tasks. Note the picture on the side will visually explain the exact commands. With the commands, a person could tell Git exactly who the author is, create a new local repository in order to connect more people to the file(s),or check out a repository. It could even add files, then commit those files to the next phase, to be then pushed to the remote repository from the local one. With the many commands that are allowed to be performed, a person could check the "status" of any file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">State to State</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As a way to fully understand Git, one has to see the different areas where files can be. This allows to quickly comprehend the commands previously mentioned. The three states that views files are: committed, modified, and staged. Modified, can also be similar to the untracked state, is the place where files are which is the "purgatory" or waiting area for files as they are not yet in a local or remote repository. Staged is the area where files are added or pushed to be taken a screenshot of. Committed area is usually the "final" state or more so, when the file is in the local repository and is safely stored.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Teamwork makes the Dream work</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As version control systems have been explained to be great for team collaboration, there are more reasons to use Git and other VCS than it allows for file sharing. With Git, it will automatically note who changed the file, so as to keep a structured list of all the authors and editors. On top of that, it could note the date and time when the file was changed or modified so as to know which is the latest version. It will even note what was changed or even added to the file so as to save the time looking for those aspects. It could even merge the files, when more than one person is working on it, so the all changes could be blended into one final product.</p>
